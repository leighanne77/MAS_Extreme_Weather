# TODO: Next Steps for Climate Risk Analysis Multi-Agent System

## Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Reinstall all dependencies with the updated requirements.txt
- [ ] Test the system using test_system.py and test_weather.py
- [ ] Verify that all modules import correctly after the refactor
- [ ] Check for any remaining Python 3.12 compatibility issues
- [ ] Update the README.md with any new usage instructions or troubleshooting tips

## Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add more test cases for different locations and risk scenarios
- [ ] Implement more robust error handling and logging throughout the system
- [ ] Add support for additional climate data sources/APIs
- [ ] Expand the agent team with more specialized agents (e.g., insurance, emergency response)
- [ ] Improve the caching mechanism (e.g., persistent cache, cache invalidation strategies)
- [ ] Add a web or CLI interface for user interaction
- [ ] Integrate user authentication and session management for multi-user support
- [ ] Add visualization tools for risk analysis results
- [ ] Implement automated deployment scripts (Docker, CI/CD)

## Code Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Increase test coverage and add automated tests
- [ ] Refactor code for clarity and maintainability
- [ ] Update and expand documentation (docstrings, usage examples, architecture diagrams)
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Research & Exploration
- [ ] Explore integration with LLMs for more advanced reasoning and recommendations
- [ ] Investigate additional data sources for historical and real-time climate data
- [ ] Research best practices for multi-agent coordination and communication
- [ ] Stay updated on new Python releases and package compatibility

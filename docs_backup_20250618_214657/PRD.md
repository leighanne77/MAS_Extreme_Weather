# Tool - LLM-Powered Natural Capital Risk Assessment

## Core Problem
Investors lack tools to quantify financial risks from environmental degradation and lack actionable nature-first resilience solutions.

## Solution Overview
Multi-agent LLM system that:
- Quantifies natural capital risks for investment portfolios
- Provides nature-first resilience recommendations
- Focuses on 5-7 year investment horizons
- Delivers bioregional decision support

**Economic Focus**
- Scenarios are aligned with the  economic problems - initially drawn from the prototypes then will be generated with refreshing for edge cases and macro changes
- Update filter descriptions to reflect the economic optimization goals
- Include ROI calculations that match the user type's economic challenges
- Add risk-adjusted return metrics for investment-focused users

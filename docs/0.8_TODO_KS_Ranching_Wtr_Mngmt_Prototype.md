**Extreme Weather Risk Data Sources for Kansas Ranching:**
- **Drought monitoring** (USDA, USGS) - Drought monitoring, agricultural weather patterns, water availability data
- **Extreme heat frequency data** (National Weather Service) - Extreme heat frequency and duration data
- **Water availability data** (USGS, Kansas Water Office) - Water availability and quality data for inland regions
- **Agricultural weather patterns** (USDA) - Agricultural statistics and policy data
- **Ogallala Aquifer monitoring data** - Groundwater levels and quality data for agricultural operations


#### 5. How Pythia Provides These Improvements (including which data sources are used for this example)
Using these data sets

**5.1 This Prototype: Extreme Weather and Related Risks**

The multi-agent system pulls in extreme weather and related risks data to create a comprehensive risk assessment for Kansas ranching operations:

**Geographic Risk Assessment**: Location-specific drought, extreme heat, and water scarcity analysis for ranching operations in Kansas, including pasture and feed availability assessments based on local soil and climate conditions.

**Regional Adaptation Strategies**: Proven water management and drought-resistant ranching solutions for Kansas, including rotational grazing, water conservation techniques, and feed management strategies.

**Local Ecosystem Integration**: Kansas prairie ecosystem considerations including grassland health and biodiversity, soil conservation practices, and sustainable ranching methods.

**Risk Stack Ranking for Kansas Ranching:**
1. **Drought/water scarcity** - Primary risk affecting pasture quality and feed availability
2. **Extreme heat** - Secondary risk affecting livestock health and productivity
3. **Ogallala Aquifer depletion** - Long-term risk affecting water availability for ranching operations
4. **Grassland degradation** - Environmental risk affecting pasture sustainability
5. **Feed availability** - Economic risk affecting ranching profitability and loan repayment capacity

The system cross-validates these risks using multiple data sources including USDA drought data, USGS water availability data, and local agricultural statistics to provide confidence levels for each risk assessment.

### **Notification System Design:**

#### **When to Offer Notifications:**
- **After Risk Analysis:** If risks are found, offer to monitor those specific risks
- **After Derisking Strategy Selection:** Offer to monitor the effectiveness of chosen solutions
- **After Implementation:** Offer to track progress of implemented strategies

#### **Notification Types:**
- **Risk Monitoring:** Track specific risk factors identified in analysis
- **Strategy Effectiveness:** Monitor if chosen derisking strategies are working
- **Data Updates:** Notify when new relevant data becomes available
- **Success Indicators:** Alert when positive trends emerge from chosen strategies

#### **Notification Settings:**
- **Frequency Options:** Weekly, monthly, quarterly, or on significant changes
- **Confidentiality:** All notifications stay within Tool tool, not shared externally
- **User Control:** Users can enable/disable notifications at any time
- **Customization:** Users can choose which specific metrics to monitor

### **Key Principles for New Filters:**

1. **Provide Frameworks, Not Results:** Give users tools to calculate their own metrics
2. **Focus on External Data:** Use publicly available data and benchmarks
3. **Emphasize Success Stories:** Share proven strategies from similar operations
4. **Include Regulatory Guidance:** Help with compliance without accessing internal data
5. **Offer Risk Assessment Tools:** Provide methods for users to assess their own risks
6. **Optional Monitoring:** Offer notifications only after analysis and strategy selection
7. **Confidential Notifications:** All monitoring stays within Tool tool

Section One: User Story

Format  "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a specific goal or benefit]." All stories adhere to the INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) with particular focus on the "Valuable" aspect.  

As a PE investor:

I want to… 
- use the risk assessment offered by Pythia on extreme weather, hurricanes, sea level rise, extreme heat, water scarcity, energy grid vulnerabilities, and sargassum blooms with verified, localized information and risk modeling delivered to me now, in 2025, both pre-and post-investment in hospitality assets for the investment time horizon of 5 years (exit in 2030)
- and I want … 
to add proven nature-first risk mitigation options and success stories - with ROI analysis (low, medium, high) 
so that… 
- I can factor in, accurately, these physical risks with no mitigations (red flag scenario) and with options for high ROI mitigations (green flag scenarios) because they are currently missing in most hospitality investment decisions,  
so that… 
so that…
- I can factor in better risk pricing and any risk mitigations that could increase IRR and exit value, enhancing how my hospitality investment could become more resilient as weather grows more extreme overall from 2025-2030
bonus… 
- which should, if I do this and request risk mitigations as part of deal terms across many investments, should increase the overall value of my overall portfolio and prevent stranded assets    




Section Two: User Journey

Pythia System Parts: Basic -> Better -> Advanced 

Basic
Part One: Basic - More Accurate Risk Pricing and Exit Value Calculations

User Problems Pythia Solves in this Part 
- Limited visibility on physical risks from hurricanes, sea level rise, extreme heat, water scarcity, energy grid vulnerabilities, and sargassum blooms on hospitality operations and physical assets beyond one-off consulting reports
- No ability to assemble such data in time for investment decisions
- No systematic modeling including how these risks can decrease investment value/outputs or how they can be mitigated and the ROI on exit value from that

Step 1. User Input

"What are hurricane, sea level rise, extreme heat, water scarcity, energy grid vulnerabilities, and sargassum bloom risks for a large new luxury resort development near the ocean in South Florida and the Caribbean, with new buildings constructed by late 2025-early 2026, over the next 5 years and how would this impact the value of this facility in 2030?"

Step 2. Pythia Output (Part I of II)

"For the goal of calculating exit value by 2030, using what is available today (July 12, 2025) for an investment in a hospitality company with (under construction) a new luxury resort that will be operational by December 2025, here is the basic risk assessment for extreme weather, hurricanes, sea level rise, extreme heat, water scarcity, energy grid vulnerabilities, and sargassum blooms: You should include three main periodic risks and one persistent risk: extreme heat. 

The first periodic risk: Hurricanes. You should include two instances of category 4 or 5 hurricanes hitting the facility over the course of your investment time period (2025-2030), leading to impacts including downtimes, facility repairs, and tourism disruption resulting in decreased annual revenues of 15-25%. Details below will help you discover if you should include the higher or lower number in IRR calculations. Note: The estimated impacts on exit value are based on estimations on how the facility is constructed for various use cases (using existing building regulations) for both luxury and standard hospitality properties, you can filter by which type, below. To increase exit value we have high ROI risk mitigations, and these include success stories from similar types of assets in similar geographies.

The second periodic risk: Sargassum seaweed blooms. This risk is going to lead to periodic beach access restrictions and negative guest experiences due to annual sargassum blooms affecting beach access and water activities. This will lead to decreased guest satisfaction, potential cancellations, and 5-10% revenue impacts during bloom periods. We have high ROI risk mitigation techniques and success stories for this, as well.

The third periodic risk: Energy grid vulnerabilities. This risk is going to lead to periodic power outages during extreme weather events, affecting guest experience and operational continuity. This will require backup power systems and energy resilience measures, with 3-7% operational cost increases starting in 2027. We have high ROI risk mitigation techniques including solar and geothermal solutions with success stories for this, as well.

The persistent risk: Extreme heat. This ongoing risk is going to get more severe in the coming five years based on localized weather and expert knowledge estimates, driving up cooling costs and affecting guest comfort. High ROI risk mitigation techniques and adaptations are included in Part II." 

See Part Two (next)


Better
Part Two: Better - Increasing Exit Values through High ROI Risk Mitigation

Risk Mitigation: Problems for the User in this Part
- No ability to optimize by reviewing risk mitigation options for the 2025-2030 investment horizon, and the more rapid and extreme weather changes
- No ability to find and recommend localized, high ROI risk mitigations to include in IRR calculations
- No ability to have how this can be communicated by them, the investor, as part of deal terms

Step 1.  User Input: Already Done 

same as Part One, above - no additional input needed from user

Step 2. Pythia Output: (Part II of II)

Continued from Part I

"... Our "Green Flag" scenario-based analysis (below) shows you what would be the best resilience options for your potential investment. You have options to choose which risk mitigations (ranked by highest ROI, first) and create better scenarios. Since the facility is under construction, some of these risk mitigations may be easier to adopt and that is noted. Double click on any scenario for more, like what kinds of source data are used, and why we chose some nature-based/nature-first risk mitigations over others. Estimates of total impact on exit value will be recalculated as you need - just an estimate.

The "Red Flag" scenario is what it would look like if you do not adopt any resilience measures, and estimates of total (negative) impact on exit value."


Advanced
Part Three: Advanced -  Resilience and Exit Values 

Resilience: Problems for the User in This Part 
- No ability to monitor how risk mitigations are effective and how they impact the exit value of the investment, over time 

Step 1. User Input: Already Done

FYI: The user can filter or click options and refine the query but the final ask from Pythia will always persist.

Step 2. Pythia Output: Advanced Follow Up  

"If you do adopt any resilience options for your investment, do you want to be able to track them to quantify this effectiveness? If you do, here are general metrics and tracking tips that are friendly to use. However, you can augment them to meet any regulated industry requirements. We'd like to help more, and confidential to you use of (only) post-investment data from your side will be part of this.

*****

#### 1.  Data We Cannot Access Due to Regulated Industry Requirements (Pythia is decision support, not integrated automations for decision making)
- The PE firm's own existing portfolio data or any deal notes
- The investment's financial information, we can only use estimates based on external data
- The PE firms' Internal risk assessments, any consulting reports they commissioned for this risk, or any internal performance metrics calculated for this investment

Pythia Cannot Do
- Cannot be part of any automations in financial decisions due to liabilities coming in normal regulated industry requirements, so just offering decision support 
- Analogy: "Like" Google maps helps you find your way, but does NOT drive your car or otherwise force driver behaviors 

#### 2.  Current PE Investment Decision-Making Process (Estimated) 
- Fund Portfolio Construction: Not that often, every other year at most plus quarterly meetings reviewing investments for potential to assemble into the fund portfolio
- Single Investment Deal Terms: Not that often, every other year at most for a handful of investments, at the same time as the portfolio construction
- Investment Modifications: Yearly or more frequently as needed and which can include restructuring of management and assets (PE)

FAQ for this: 

Would Pythia be used in each part of this process? Yes. While investment folks use the tool daily to just think through ideas, the decisions on investing by a PE firm is not that often. The Part III is where we can start to see actual use - still outside of investment decisions but now part of decision support for near daily operations.

#### 5. How Pythia Provides These Improvements (including which data sources are used for this example)
Using these data sets

**5.1 This Prototype: Extreme Weather and Related Risks**

The multi-agent system pulls in extreme weather and related risks data to create a comprehensive risk assessment for South Florida and Caribbean hospitality facilities:

**Geographic Risk Assessment**: Location-specific hurricane, sea level rise, and sargassum analysis for hospitality facilities in South Florida and Caribbean, including facility-specific vulnerability assessments based on construction type and coastal location.

**Regional Adaptation Strategies**: Proven coastal protection and tourism resilience solutions for South Florida and Caribbean, including nature-based solutions like mangrove restoration and structural solutions like elevated infrastructure.

**Local Ecosystem Integration**: Coastal ecosystem considerations including coral reef health and marine biodiversity, beach nourishment strategies, and sustainable tourism practices.

**Risk Stack Ranking for South Florida and Caribbean Hospitality:**
1. **Hurricanes (Category 4-5)** - Primary risk with 3.2 average annual storms in Gulf Coast region
2. **Sargassum blooms** - Secondary risk affecting beach access and guest experience
3. **Energy grid vulnerabilities** - Infrastructure risk requiring backup power systems
4. **Sea level rise** - Long-term risk affecting coastal property values
5. **Extreme heat** - Persistent risk driving up cooling costs and affecting guest comfort

The system cross-validates these risks using multiple data sources including NOAA NHC hurricane data, USGS sea level rise projections, and local Florida agency data to provide confidence levels for each risk assessment.

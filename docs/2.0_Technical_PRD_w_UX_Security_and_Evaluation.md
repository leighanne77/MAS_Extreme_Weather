## Introduction

This is a multi-agent system that's a stateful, memory-enabled wrapper to use with the Google Gemini LLM, following solid software engineering principles. The agents are really just specialized microservices that handle different aspects of data processing, memory, and state management. Our system can provide complex risk assessments and recommendations - because it is not just the LLM doing the work, but the entire software infrastructure built around it that makes it useful and reliable.

- **Take user input**: Handled by `src/multi_agent_system/agents/base_agent.py` and `src/multi_agent_system/communication.py`
- **Process it through specialized components (agents)**: Orchestrated by `src/multi_agent_system/agent_team.py` and `src/multi_agent_system/coordinator.py`
- **Maintain state across interactions**: Managed by `src/multi_agent_system/session_manager.py` and `src/agentic_data_management/data_manager.py`
- **Finds and format data for LLM consumption**: Processed by `src/multi_agent_system/data/data_loader.py` and `src/multi_agent_system/data_management.py`
- **Store results and context**: Handled by `src/agentic_data_management/agents/lifecycle_agent.py` and `src/multi_agent_system/artifact_manager.py`
- **Handle security and compliance**: Managed by `src/agentic_data_management/agents/security_agent.py` and `src/agentic_data_management/governance.py`

## 1. Core Problem
Capital market actors lack tools to quantify financial risks from environmental degradation and extreme weather, and lack actionable nature-first resilience solutions when assessing an investable asset, a current investments, a loans, etc. 

## 2. Solution Overview
Multi-agent LLM system that:
- Quantifies extreme weather, heat and related environmental risks for investment portfolios
- Provides nature-first resilience recommendations 
- Focuses on 5-7 year investment horizons
- Delivers bioregional decision support
- For investors, managers, owners, bankers, and other capital market actors

## 3. What Tool Does Not Do 
- Calculates IRR: Tool does not access any of the proprietary data of our capital market users but augments their work
- Automates Risk Decisions: Tool provides decision support, and does not wade into regulated industry decision automations
- Portfolio-level (investments or loans) risk analysis: Tool only works on one action on one asset or loan or other financial action at a time
- Insurance options: Tool does not do any insurance-related advising

### **Data Access Limitations and UX Workarounds**
- **IRR Calculations**: Cannot access user's proprietary IRR models, but provides construction cost factors, timeline impacts, and ROI data from similar projects
- **Loan Data**: Cannot access individual loan information, but provides risk factors and success rates from similar operations
- **Portfolio Data**: Cannot access user's portfolio details, but provides risk assessment frameworks and methods
- **ESG Metrics**: Cannot access user's ESG calculations, but provides measurement frameworks and benchmarks
- **Premium Calculations**: Cannot access insurance premium data, but provides risk assessment data and frameworks
- **Credit Data**: Cannot access user's credit information, but provides cash flow and seasonal planning data
- **Budget Data**: Cannot access government budget details, but provides impact assessment frameworks

**For comprehensive restrictions and guidelines, see [1.3_System_Do_Not_Dos.md](1.3_System_Do_Not_Dos.md)**

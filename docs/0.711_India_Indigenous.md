- No respectful way to share traditional knowledge without losing cultural control
- No ability to contribute ancestral wisdom to investment decisions that affect traditional lands
- No platform to ensure collective benefit from knowledge sharing
- No way to ensure traditional knowledge is used in culturally appropriate ways

Step 1. Indigenous Data Provider Onboarding, Start

Pythia Prompt: "Welcome, we are honored that you are interested in sharing your traditional knowledge with us. What is your role in your community?"

Indigenous Data Provider Response: "I am a cultural knowledge keeper for our tribal community, with deep understanding of Tamil Nadu district ecosystems passed down through generations. I have traditional knowledge about monsoon patterns, agricultural cycles, water management, and ecosystem health that could help inform district planning decisions. I want to share this knowledge respectfully and ensure our community benefits."

Pythia Response: "Welcome to Pythia's respectful traditional knowledge sharing platform. Your ancestral wisdom about Tamil Nadu district ecosystems is invaluable for informing district planning decisions that affect traditional lands. Here's how we can work together respectfully:

**Traditional Knowledge Sharing Process:**
- Your traditional knowledge remains under your community's control at all times
- We use Google Cloud Confidential Compute to process knowledge without storing it
- Our A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol ensures secure knowledge transmission

- Cultural protocols are respected throughout the process

**Verification Process:**
- We cross-verify traditional knowledge against multiple sources while respecting cultural protocols
- This verification happens in secure, isolated compute environments
- Your original knowledge is never shared with unauthorized parties
- Verification results are used to enhance confidence in scenario generation

**Collective Compensation Structure:**
- Base compensation for traditional knowledge contribution: Volume-based payment per verified knowledge set
- Community benefit fund: Quarterly payments for community projects
- Cultural consultation fees: Hourly rates for specialized cultural analysis

# Cursor Rules for Pythia Work

**Date Created**: July 2, 2025
**Date Last Updated**: July 12, 2025

## Core Rules for Pythia Development

### **1. Always Review System_Do_Not_Dos.md**
- Before making any changes or suggestions, review `docs/1.3_System_Do_Not_Dos.md`
- Ensure all proposed changes align with system constraints and limitations
- Check against established "do not do" guidelines

### **2. Do not make up anything** - no data sources or files that do not exist in our src/ files, 

### **3. No File Changes Without Explicit Approval**
- **DO NOT** truncate, change, delete, or add to any file unless explicitly approved
- **ALWAYS** suggest changes first, then wait for user approval
- Present options and recommendations before making any modifications
- Get explicit confirmation before proceeding with file edits

### **4. Do Not Make Up Data Sources**
- Only reference real, existing data sources with verified URLs
- Do not create fictional APIs, datasets, or data providers
- Verify all data source links and access methods before suggesting them
- If unsure about a data source, state that it needs verification

### **5. No Real-Time Data Feed Promises**
- Remember that the system does not provide real-time data feeds
- Data refresh intervals are 1-6 hours, not real-time
- Do not promise or suggest real-time monitoring capabilities
- Focus on scheduled data updates and batch processing

### **6. Do not make up users for prototypes that do not belong in that prototype**

### **7. Do not make up files that do not exist in this Pythia program, already**

### **8. in docs/ files always update the change log but keep the description of changes as short as possible**

### **9. In docs/ files always update the date changed at the top**

### **10. Do not promise outcomes that are 20% or other percent improvements only say "statistically significant and measurable"**
- Remember that the system does not ever integrate into Private Equity banks or other financial services system
- Focus on how this is a decision support tool, NOT a a decision making tool and cannot be automated into any systems

## Implementation Guidelines

### **When Suggesting Changes:**
1. Review `System_Do_Not_Dos.md` first
2. Present clear options with pros/cons
3. Wait for explicit approval
4. Only then proceed with implementation

### **When Researching Data Sources:**
1. Verify URLs and access methods
2. Check if sources actually exist
3. Confirm access requirements (free vs. paid, registration needed)
4. Do not invent or assume data availability

### **When Discussing System Capabilities:**
1. Be accurate about data refresh rates
2. Don't overpromise real-time features
3. Focus on actual implemented capabilities
4. Acknowledge system limitations honestly

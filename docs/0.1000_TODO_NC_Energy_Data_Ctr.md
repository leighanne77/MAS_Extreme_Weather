4.1 Data Quality, how does the Pythia system make data quality checks?  

#### 5. How Pythia Provides These Improvements (including which data sources are used for this example)
Using these data sets

**5.1 This Prototype: Extreme Weather and Related Risks**

The multi-agent system pulls in extreme weather and related risks data to create a comprehensive risk assessment for North Carolina energy and data center facilities:

**Geographic Risk Assessment**: Location-specific extreme heat, flooding, and energy grid analysis for data center facilities in North Carolina, including facility-specific vulnerability assessments based on cooling system efficiency and power infrastructure.

**Regional Adaptation Strategies**: Proven energy efficiency and cooling optimization solutions for inland data centers, including advanced cooling technologies, energy management systems, and backup power solutions.

**Local Ecosystem Integration**: Inland ecosystem considerations including urban heat island effects, water management for cooling systems, and sustainable energy practices.

**Risk Stack Ranking for North Carolina Energy & Data Centers:**
1. **Extreme heat** - Primary risk affecting cooling system efficiency and energy costs
2. **Energy grid reliability** - Secondary risk affecting power availability and backup requirements
3. **Cooling system efficiency** - Infrastructure risk affecting operational costs and performance
4. **Inland flooding** - Environmental risk affecting facility access and operations
5. **Water availability for cooling** - Resource risk affecting cooling system sustainability

The system cross-validates these risks using multiple data sources including NWS heat data, EIA energy grid data, and local North Carolina agency data to provide confidence levels for each risk assessment.

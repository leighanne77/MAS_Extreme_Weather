https://github.com/CliDyn/climsight ClimSight is an open-source tool specifically designed to make localized climate information accessible and actionable. 

July 2025 Development: Pre-downscaled: cmip6-downscaling is a GitHub repository provides an intake catalog that allows programmatic access to the entire collection of daily, pre-downscaled CMIP6 datasets. These are typically stored as Zarr stores on cloud object storage (GCP, Amazon S3, etc.) can be accessed as datasets using highly efficient using Python libraries like  xarray and fsspec.

After July 2025: Bespoke Downscaling: When pre-computed data does not precisely meet specific requirements the cmip6-downscaling repository provides the underlying tools and scripts for bespoke climate downscaling. NOTE: While running downscaling oneself offers greater customizability for bespoke needs, it is significantly more compute-intensive  I liked that they used MACA (Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs) a statistical downscaling method that translates GCM outputs to higher spatial resolutions (e.g., 4-6km).
 

Business Workflow Stage

ClimSight (https://github.com/CliDyn/climsight)

1. Onboarding

Focuses on integrating structured climate data with diverse external sources for contextual understanding.

2. Data Prep

Leverages Python-based tools like xarray, geopandas, pandas, netcdf4 for comprehensive data handling and download_data.py for acquisition.

3. Risk Model "Training"

Focuses on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and synthesize information from various climate sources for assessments.

4. Future Risk Projections

Integrates new climate data, which can include GCM output and scientific reports, for LLM processing and synthesis.

5. Hyper-Local Risk Prediction

Leverages LLMs to provide context-aware, actionable insights and answers to complex climate queries. Does not directly produce gridded forecasts.

6. Impact & Risk Mitigation Analysis

Provides direct, contextualized climate assessments and insights, aiding in understanding potential impacts and mitigation based on synthesized information.

Consideration

ClimSight (https://github.com/CliDyn/climsight)

Value Proposition

Provides actionable insights and contextualized climate assessments using LLMs, integrating diverse data for comprehensive understanding.

Investment (Cost/Time)

Requires an OpenAI API key for LLM calls (unless skipLLMCall is used) and potentially resources for integrating diverse data sources. Deployment can be done via Docker.

Accuracy & Granularity

Focuses on synthesizing accurate, localized, and context-aware climate assessments through LLM interpretation, rather than producing raw gridded data.

Explainability

Aims to provide understandable, natural language responses for complex climate queries due to its LLM-based approach.

Future Resilience

Leverages the adaptability of LLMs to interpret and synthesize information from new and evolving climate data and scientific reports.

Best For

Users needing contextualized climate assessments, actionable insights, and an intuitive, natural language interface for climate-related queries across diverse data.

- No secure way to submit local knowledge and scientific data without losing control over the data
- No ability to contribute expertise to district planning decisions that affect local ecosystems
- No platform to monetize specialized local knowledge and scientific expertise
- No way to ensure data is used responsibly and confidentially

Step 1. Expert Data Provider Onboarding, Start

Pythia Prompt: "Welcome, we are glad you are interested in helping us as an expert data provider, what do you do?"

Expert Data Provider Response: "I am a climate scientist with 15 years of experience studying Tamil Nadu district ecosystems. I have data on monsoon patterns, agricultural cycles, water availability trends, and extreme weather events that could help inform district planning and agricultural development decisions. I want to contribute this data securely and be compensated for my expertise."

Pythia Response: "Welcome to Pythia's secure data contribution platform. Your expertise in Tamil Nadu district ecosystems is valuable for informing district planning decisions that affect bioregional health. Here's how we can work together securely:

**Data Submission Process:**
- Your data remains under your control at all times
- We use Google Cloud Confidential Compute to process your data without storing it
- Our A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol ensures secure data transmission
- Your data is only used for generating risk assessment scenarios, never stored permanently

**Verification Process:**
- We cross-verify your data against multiple third-party sources (IMD, CWC, CGWB, Ministry of Agriculture)
- This verification happens in secure, isolated compute environments
- Your original data is never shared with third parties
- Verification results are used to enhance confidence in scenario generation

**Compensation Structure:**
- Base compensation for data contribution: Volume-based payment per verified dataset
- Bonus for high-quality, frequently referenced data: Quarterly performance bonuses
- Expert consultation fees: Hourly rates for specialized analysis
- Revenue sharing for data that leads to successful nature-based solutions

Step 2: Pythia Prompt: "We have a few follow-up questions to onboard you, including what geographic regions you cover. Stop at any time to ask questions you want about the system."

**Onboarding Questions:**
1. **Geographic Coverage**: What specific areas of Tamil Nadu district do you have expertise in?
2. **Data Types**: What types of data do you have (monsoon patterns, agricultural cycles, water availability, extreme weather, etc.)?

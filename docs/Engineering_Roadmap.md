## **Product Strategy**

### **Open Core Business Model**
We're building an open core model where the fundamental climate risk analysis engine is free and open-source, but commercial versions include enterprise features like SLAs, priority support, and advanced integrations. This approach gives us several advantages:

- **Community Growth**: Free access for researchers, smaller organizations, and community members drives adoption and feedback
- **Market Validation**: Open-source users help us validate use cases before we invest in commercial feature development
- **Maintenance Strategy**: We maintain security and core functionality for the FOSS version while monetizing premium features
- **Customer Pipeline**: The open-source repo serves as a proof-of-concept platform for enterprise customers

### **Initial Prototype Development**
Our first real-world test focuses on water management challenges for agricultural operations that depend on stressed water resources. This prototype targets specific investment horizons (2030, 2033, 2035 projections) and combines historical weather data, geographic information, biodiversity metrics, and local indigenous knowledge.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users query the system conversationally rather than learning complex interfaces
- **Full Auditability**: Every recommendation includes clear explanations of data sources, models used, and decision logic
- **Attribution & Compensation**: Track knowledge contributions for eventual payment to data providers and local experts
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Present weather projection uncertainty in business-friendly terms
- **Replicable Design**: Build it once, deploy it anywhere with similar use cases

## To Consider: 
When to use API Agents: High-frequency data analysis for speed and reliability 
When to use GUI Agents: Legacy or proprietary software common in research for capital markets (many portfolio companies use outdated systems), visual validation of investment presentations, or interacting with materials that lack APIs (most of them)
Hybrid Approach: Most valuable for partial API coverage scenarios where you have some structured data sources but need to supplement with manual system interactions.

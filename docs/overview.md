## Architecture Decision

### Hybrid Approach: Custom Core + ADK Coordination
We have chosen a hybrid architecture that combines our custom implementation with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for the following reasons:

1. **Core Components (Custom)**
   - Climate-specific risk analysis logic
   - Weather data caching and processing
   - Specialized agent tools for climate analysis
   - Custom session management for climate data

2. **Agent Coordination (ADK)**
   - Multi-agent system orchestration
   - Event handling and communication
   - Workflow management
   - Session state management

## Observability and Error Recovery

### State Management
- Durable state management through checkpoints
- Automatic state persistence and restoration
- Context preservation across tool calls
- Tool call history tracking

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling with severity-based recovery
- Automatic rollback to last known good state
- Detailed error context for debugging
- Configurable recovery strategies

# Engineering Draft DevOps

This document contains DevOps-related suggestions and requirements for the MAS system that were separated from the main Engineering Roadmap.

## **Deployment and DevOps Requirements**

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Automated Testing**: Include CI/CD pipeline requirements for each phase
- **Build Automation**: Automated build and deployment processes
- **Environment Management**: Automated environment provisioning
- **Release Management**: Automated release processes and rollbacks

### **Environment Strategy**
- **Development Environment**: Add development environment requirements
- **Staging Environment**: Add staging environment requirements  
- **Production Environment**: Add production environment requirements
- **Environment Isolation**: Ensure proper isolation between environments

### **Rollback Procedures**
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Include detailed rollback procedures
- **Data Recovery**: Automated data recovery procedures
- **Service Recovery**: Automated service recovery procedures
- **Rollback Testing**: Regular testing of rollback procedures

### **Deployment Windows**
- **Deployment Scheduling**: Add deployment window requirements and constraints
- **Maintenance Windows**: Scheduled maintenance windows
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Blue-green deployment strategies
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollout strategies

### **Infrastructure as Code**
- **IaC Requirements**: Include IaC requirements for all infrastructure
- **Terraform/CloudFormation**: Infrastructure provisioning automation
- **Configuration Management**: Automated configuration management
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Automated infrastructure testing

### **Monitoring and Alerting**
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Monitor infrastructure health and performance
- **Application Monitoring**: Monitor application performance and errors
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging and log analysis
- **Alert Management**: Automated alerting and escalation procedures

### **Security and Compliance**
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Compliance Checks**: Automated compliance checking
- **Secret Management**: Secure secret and credential management
- **Access Control**: Automated access control and permissions

### **Backup and Recovery**
- **Automated Backups**: Automated backup procedures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Disaster recovery procedures and testing
- **Data Retention**: Automated data retention and cleanup
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures

## **Database Strategy**

### **Current Infrastructure**
- **Immediate Implementation**: Use existing database infrastructure and cloud services
- **Scalability Planning**: Design for horizontal scaling with current technology stack
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching, indexing, and query optimization
- **Data Migration**: Plan for seamless data migration when upgrading infrastructure

### **Future Database Evolution**
- **Spanner Graph Migration (Future - 6+ Months)**: Migrate to Spanner Graph for global distribution and native graph capabilities when scale requirements demand it
- **Migration Triggers**: 
  - Global distribution requirements
  - Complex graph relationship queries
  - Performance bottlenecks with current infrastructure
  - Multi-region deployment needs
- **Migration Strategy**: 
  - Gradual migration with dual-write capability
  - Comprehensive testing and validation
  - Zero-downtime migration procedures
  - Rollback capabilities during transition

## **Future Considerations**

These DevOps requirements will be integrated into the main Engineering Roadmap when the system is ready for production deployment and requires comprehensive DevOps infrastructure.

The database strategy emphasizes using current infrastructure effectively while planning for future Spanner Graph migration when the system's scale and complexity requirements justify the investment.

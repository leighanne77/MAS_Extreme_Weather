### **Analysis Summary:**

**Value Propositions Tool Provides:**
- Enhanced visibility into extreme weather impacts through analysis
- Proven resilience strategies from similar operations
- Data-driven insights for decision-making
- Success stories and case studies
- Optional monitoring notifications for chosen derisking strategies

**Data Limitations:** For detailed information on data we cannot access and user-specific constraints, see [0.6_DRAFT_DNU_User_Journeys_by_Prototypes.md](docs/0.6_DRAFT_DNU_User_Journeys_by_Prototypes.md)

### **Suggested New Filter Approach:**

#### **For Private Equity Investors:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their IRR calculations, so we focus on providing data they can use to calculate IRR themselves.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Construction Cost Risk Factors    ☑️ Timeline Impact Analysis    ☑️ Operational Risk Scenarios
☑️ Resilience Strategy ROI Data    ☑️ Success Story Benchmarks    ☑️ Regulatory Compliance Guidance
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Highest IRR," we provide construction cost factors, timeline impacts, and ROI data from similar projects that they can use in their own IRR calculations.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen derisking strategies and notify when data shows effectiveness.

#### **For Loan Officers:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access individual loan data, so we focus on risk factors and resilience strategies.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Collateral Risk Factors    ☑️ Resilience Strategy Success Rates    ☑️ Regional Risk Benchmarks
☑️ Risk Assessment Frameworks    ☑️ Borrower Support Resources    ☑️ Regulatory Compliance Data
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Lowest Default Risk," we provide risk factors and success rates from similar operations that they can apply to their own loan assessments.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen resilience strategies and notify when data shows improved risk profiles.

#### **For Data Science Officers:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their internal models, so we provide validation data and benchmarks.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Data Quality Metrics    ☑️ Validation Dataset Sources    ☑️ Model Performance Benchmarks
☑️ Integration Best Practices    ☑️ ROI Calculation Frameworks    ☑️ Success Story Case Studies
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Model Accuracy," we provide external validation data and benchmarks they can use to validate their own models.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor data quality trends and notify when new validation datasets become available.

#### **For Chief Risk Officers:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their portfolio data, so we provide risk assessment frameworks.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Portfolio Risk Assessment Frameworks    ☑️ Regulatory Compliance Guidelines    ☑️ Capital Allocation Benchmarks
☑️ Risk Quantification Methods    ☑️ Resilience Strategy ROI Data    ☑️ Industry Best Practices
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Portfolio Risk Reduction," we provide frameworks and methods they can apply to their own portfolio analysis.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen risk mitigation strategies and notify when data shows effectiveness.

#### **For Chief Sustainability Officers:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their ESG metrics, so we provide measurement frameworks and benchmarks.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ ESG Measurement Frameworks    ☑️ Biodiversity Impact Metrics    ☑️ Green Financing Benchmarks
☑️ Stakeholder Communication Templates    ☑️ Regulatory Compliance Guidelines    ☑️ Success Story Case Studies
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "ESG Compliance," we provide measurement frameworks and benchmarks they can use to assess their own compliance.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen sustainability strategies and notify when data shows improved environmental impacts.

#### **For Private Insurer - Insurance Agents:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their premium calculations, so we provide risk assessment data.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Claims Risk Assessment Data    ☑️ Resilience Strategy Effectiveness    ☑️ Regional Risk Benchmarks
☑️ Premium Setting Frameworks    ☑️ Risk Pool Diversification Data    ☑️ Regulatory Compliance Guidelines
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Claims Reduction," we provide risk assessment data and frameworks they can use to set their own premiums.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen resilience strategies and notify when data shows reduced risk profiles.

#### **For Banking - Credit Officers (Operating):**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their credit data, so we provide cash flow and seasonal planning data.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Cash Flow Impact Analysis    ☑️ Seasonal Planning Frameworks    ☑️ Working Capital Optimization Data
☑️ Default Prevention Strategies    ☑️ Credit Utilization Benchmarks    ☑️ Success Story Case Studies
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Cash Flow Improvement," we provide impact analysis and frameworks they can apply to their own credit decisions.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen seasonal planning strategies and notify when data shows improved cash flow patterns.

#### **For Public - Gov Funders:**
**Current Problem:** We can't access their budget data, so we provide impact assessment frameworks.

**Suggested Filters:**
```
☑️ Economic Impact Assessment Methods    ☑️ Social Impact Measurement Frameworks    ☑️ Budget Efficiency Benchmarks
☑️ Infrastructure Investment ROI Data    ☑️ Community Resilience Metrics    ☑️ Rural Development Success Stories
```

**Rationale:** Instead of "Economic Development Impact," we provide assessment methods and frameworks they can use to measure their own impact.

**Optional Notifications:** After analysis, offer to monitor chosen development strategies and notify when data shows improved outcomes.

### **Notification System Design:**

#### **When to Offer Notifications:**
- **After Risk Analysis:** If risks are found, offer to monitor those specific risks
- **After Derisking Strategy Selection:** Offer to monitor the effectiveness of chosen solutions
- **After Implementation:** Offer to track progress of implemented strategies

#### **Notification Types:**
- **Risk Monitoring:** Track specific risk factors identified in analysis
- **Strategy Effectiveness:** Monitor if chosen derisking strategies are working
- **Data Updates:** Notify when new relevant data becomes available
- **Success Indicators:** Alert when positive trends emerge from chosen strategies

#### **Notification Settings:**
- **Frequency Options:** Weekly, monthly, quarterly, or on significant changes
- **Confidentiality:** All notifications stay within Tool tool, not shared externally
- **User Control:** Users can enable/disable notifications at any time
- **Customization:** Users can choose which specific metrics to monitor

### **Key Principles for New Filters:**

1. **Provide Frameworks, Not Results:** Give users tools to calculate their own metrics
2. **Focus on External Data:** Use publicly available data and benchmarks
3. **Emphasize Success Stories:** Share proven strategies from similar operations
4. **Include Regulatory Guidance:** Help with compliance without accessing internal data
5. **Offer Risk Assessment Tools:** Provide methods for users to assess their own risks
6. **Optional Monitoring:** Offer notifications only after analysis and strategy selection
7. **Confidential Notifications:** All monitoring stays within Tool tool

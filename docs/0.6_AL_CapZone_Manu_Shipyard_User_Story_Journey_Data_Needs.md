Section One: User Story

_____

Format  "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a specific goal or benefit]." 

**Leverages the INVEST Criteria**:
- **Independent**: Can be developed without dependencies on other user types
- **Negotiable**: Allows for different implementation approaches
- **Valuable**: Directly impacts investment returns and portfolio performance
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for development team
- **Small**: Focused on single user type and outcome
- **Testable**: Can verify IRR impact calculations and risk assessments


As a PE investor:

I want to… 
- use the risk assessment offered by Pythia on extreme weather, heat, flooding with verified, localized information and risk modeling delivered to me now, in 2025, both pre-and post-investment in an asset for the investment time horizon of 5 years (exit in 2030)
- and I want 
… to add proven risk mititgation options and success stories - with ROI analysis (low, medium high) and with estimated cost-benefit analysis for each adaptation strategy relevant to this type of asset / operation, cross-referenced with global and hyerlocal data sets including from local data providers   
so that… 
- I can factor in, accurately, these physical risks with no mitigations (red flag scenario) and with options for high ROI mitigations (green flag scenarios) 
so that…
- I can factor in better risk pricing and any risk mitigations that could increase IRR and exit value, enhancing how my investment could become more resilient as weather grows more extreme overall from 2025-2040
bonus… 
- which should, if I do this and request risk mitigations as part of deal terms across many investments, should increase the overall value of my overall portfolio    

RELEVANT TO USER: To add to user journey, multisolving - later

**US Navy Involvement**: Defense infrastructure resilience, supply chain risk assessment, extreme weather-related impact on military operations
- **Local Fishermen and Oystermen**: Aquaculture risk management, water quality monitoring, extreme weather-related impact on marine resources
- **Seafood Processing Companies**: Supply chain resilience, water quality impact on operations, extreme weather-resilient processing strategies

Section Two: User Journey
_____

Pythia System Parts: Basic -> Better -> Advanced 

Basic
Part One: Basic - More Accurate Risk Pricing and Exit Value Calculations

User Problems Pythia Solves in this Part 
- Limited visibility on physical risks from extreme weather, head, flood, etc. on the operations and physical assets of the potential investments beyond one-off consulting reports
- No ability to assemble such data in time for investment decisions, cross-referenced with global and hyerlocal data sets (including from local data providers) 
- No systematic modeling including how these risks can decrease investment value / outputs or how they can mitigate and the ROI on exit value from that

Step 1. User Input

"What are hurricane or other extreme weather risks for a large new manufacturing facility for shipbuilding near the ocean in the American southeast, with new buildings constructed by late 2025-early 2026, over the next 5 years and how would this impact the value of this facility in 2030?”

Step 2. Pythia Output (Part I of II)

"For the goal of calculating exit value by 2030, using what is available today (July 30, 2025) for an investsment in a manufacturing company with (under construction) a new facility that will be operational by December 2025, here is the basic (Part One: Basic) risk assessment for extreme weather, heat, flooding and related: You should include two main periodic risks and one persistent risk. 

"The first periodic risk: Extreme storms. You should include two instances of category 4 of 5 hurricanes hitting the faciity over the course of your investment time period (2025-2030), leading to impacts including downtimes and facility repairs resulting in decreased  annual revenues of 2-4%. Details below will help you discover if you should include the higher or lower number in IRR calculatioons.   Note: The estimated impacts on exit value are based on estimations on how the facility is constructed for various use cases (using exisitng building regulations) for both heavy and light/mixed-used manufacturing, you can filter by which type, below. To increase exit value we have high ROI risk mitigations, and these include success stories from similar types of assets in similar geographies.”

"The second periodic risk: Health/biodiversity of water risk (red tide/pollution). This risk is going to lead to a need for more frequent replacement some facility equipment / facilities than most operational plans the industry regulations require, if that are required to be in/on the water. This is due to a. annual red tide occurances from the Gulf of Mexico and b. localized water pollution (other industrial activity) from upriver/in port. This will lead to the need to focus on incrementally rising costs for more frequent equipment refresh (leasing) and 10%+ maitenance budget increases starting in 2028. We have high ROI risk mitigation techniques and success stories for this, as well.”

"The persistent risk: Extreme heat. This ongoing risk is going to get more severe for this location in the next five years - based on localized weather and expert knowledge estimates. This will driving up cooling costs and infrastructure facility maitenance costs. High ROI risk mitigation techniques and adaptations are included in Part II." 

See Part Two (next)


Better
Part Two: Better - Increasing Exit Values through High ROI Risk Mitigation

Risk Mitigation: Problems for the User in this Part
- No ability to optimize by reviewing risk mitigation options for the 2025-2030 investment horizon, and the more rapid and extreme weather changes
- No ability to find and recommend localized, high ROI risk mitigations to include in IRR calculations
- No ability to have how this can be communicated by them, the investor, as part of deal terms.

Step 1.  User Input: Already Done 

same as Part One, above - no addition input needed from user

Step 2. Pythia Output: (Part II of II)

Continued from Part I

"… Our "Green Flag" scenario-based analysis (below) show you what would be the best resilence options for your potential investment. You have options to choose which risk mitigations (ranked by highest ROI, first) and create better scenarios. Since the facility is under construction, some of these risk mitigations may be easier to adopt and that is noted. Double click on any scenario for more, like what kinds of source data are used, and why we chose some nature-based/nature-first risk mitigations over others. Estimates of total impact on exit value will be recalculated as you need - just an estimate."

"The "Red Flag" scenario is what it would look like if you do not adopt any resilience measures, and estimates of total (negative) impact on exit value."

"Remember to double click to get more, including localized, relevant success stories."

_____
Advanced
Part Three: Advanced -  Resilience and Exit Values 

Resilience: Problems for the User in This Part 
- No ability to monitor how nature-based risk mitigations are performing against climate threats
- No quantified tracking of returns on the nature-based and other interventions 
- No evidence base for scaling successful interventions or course-correcting failing ones

Step 1. User Input: Already Done

FYI: The user can filter or click options and refine the query but the final ask from Pythia will always persists.

Step 2. Pythia Output: Advanced Follow Up  

"If you do adopt any resilience options for your investment, do you want to be able to track them to quanitfy this effectiveness? If you do, here are general metrics and tracking tips that are friendly to use. However, you can augment them to meet any regulated industry requirements. We'd like to help more, and confidential to you use of (only) post-investment data from your side will be part of this.

Section Three: Notes for this User User Story: 

_____

1.  Data We Cannot Access for That User Journey for That Private Equity User 
2.  Current Decision-Making Process (Estimated) for That User
3.  Restated User Problems Solved from User Journey (above) for That Private Equity User
4. How Pythia Provides These Improvements (including which data sources are used for this example)
5. Currently Available Data For Pythia (Integrations done, some banked in curated sets in JSON files) for this User and Use Case
6. Data Providers to Get for Pythia for this User and Use Case

*****

#### 1.  Data We Cannot Access Due to Regulated Industry Requirements (Pythia is decision support, not integrated automations for decision making)
- The PE firm's own existing portfolio data or any deal notes
- The investment's financial information, we can only use estimates based on external data
-The PE firms' Internal risk assessments, any consulting reports they commissioned for this risk, or and any internal performance metrics calculated for this investment

Pythia Cannot Do
- Cannot be part of any automations in finanical decisions due to liabilites comming in normal regulated industry requirements, so just offering decision support 
- Analogy: "Like" Google maps helps you find your way, but does NOT drive your car or otherwise force driver behaviors 

#### 2.  Current PE Investment Decision-Making Process (Estimated) 
- Fund Portoflio Construction: Not that often, every other year at most plus quarterly meetings reviewing investments for potential to assemble into the fund portoflio
- Single Investment Deal Terms: Not that often, every other year at most for a handful of investments, at the same time as the portofolio construction
- Investment Modifications: Yearly or more frequently as needed and which can include restructuring of management and assets (PE)

FAQ for this: 

Would Pythia be used in each part of this process? Yes. While investment folks use the tool daily to just think through ideas, the decisions on investing by a PE firm is not that often. The Part III is where we can start to see actual use - still outside of investment decisions but now part of decision support for near daily operations.


3.  Restated User Problems Solved from User Journey (above)

Risk Assessment: 
User Problem Pythia Solves in this step

- No ability to assemble such data in time for investment decisions
- No systematic modeling including how these risks can decrease investment value / outputs or how they can mitigate and the ROI on exit value from that

Risk Mitigation: Problems for the User Here 
- No ability to optimize by reviewing risk mitigation options for the 2025-2030 investment horizon, and the more rapid and extreme weather changes
- No ability to find and recommend localized, high ROI risk mitigations to include in IRR calculations
- No ability to have how this can be communicated by them, the investor, as part of deal terms.

Resilience: Problems for the User in This Part

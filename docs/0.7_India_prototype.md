- **Negotiable**: Allows for different implementation approaches
- **Valuable**: Directly impacts investment returns and portfolio performance
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for development team
- **Small**: Focused on single user type and outcome
- **Testable**: Can verify IRR impact calculations and risk assessments

As a District Collector:

I want to… 
- use the risk assessment offered by Pythia on extreme weather, heat, flooding with verified, localized information and risk modeling delivered to me now, in 2025, for rural adaptation to climate change risks that can be estimated in the 2026, and as far out as five years from now in 3031 
- and I want 
… to use this tool independently without any automation or other systemic dependencies to ensure the outputs are for my office, and not subject to influences beyond my office before I see them
- and I want
... to not just find risks but find proven risk mititgation options (incl. relevant success stories) with ROI analysis (low, medium high) and with estimated cost-benefit analysis for each adaptation strategy relevant to this type of asset / operation, cross-referenced with global and hyerlocal data sets (including from local data providers) 
- so that
... I can factor in, accurately, these physical risks with the scenario of no mitigations (red flag scenario) and with many options for high ROI mitigations (many green flag scenarios) 
- so that
... I can build into my work as the district collector proposals and projects with better ROI for improving rural economic, ecological, and population health
- so that
...the operations and the budget of the district collector can be optimized to improve the rural areas in my district in India more resilient as weather grows more extreme overall from 2025-2030
- bonus, so that
... which should, if I can do this many times and over many distriect could increase the overall ecological, economic, and population health of India overall

Pythia System Parts: Basic -> Better -> Advanced 

Basic

Part One: Basic - More Accurate Climate Risk Analysis for Planning 

User Problems Pythia Solves in this Part I
- Limited visibility on physical risks from extreme weather, head, flood, etc. on the ecology, economy, population health, and other indicators of well-being for the citizens in one district, beyond one-off consulting reports or snapshot data sets
- No ability to assemble such data in time for budgeting proposals and project decisions, cross-referenced with global and hyerlocal data sets
- No systematic modeling including how these risks can decrease value / outputs of existing projects or operations funded and executed by the office of the district collector in this district and beyond
- No ability to find nature-based and other solutions that can mitigate these risks (focus of Pythia's Part II) that can help at the bioregional / ecosystem level (bioregion is defined as a watershed area)

Step 1. User Input

"What are major risks from climate change and other extreme weather for the district of ___ in __(N/S) India across all , many, or one of the bioregions in this district? And how can I find ways to best address these risks in my time as district collector to help build resilience in this district over the next two to ten years?”

Step 2. Pythia Output (Part I of II)

[Pythia's multi-agent system restates the question, sketches out the bioregion(s) in the geographic area requested, asks any clarifying questions, then finds severe weather-related risks and any work already ongoing to mitigate it. Localized data is pulled in including from expert knowledge holders as needed.]

For the goal of finding risks from climate change and related severe weather to this district's bioregions by 2030, using what is available today (July 13, 2025), here is the basic (Part One: Basic) risk assessment for the district.You should include three (3) persistent risks: Rising extreme heat, water scarcity with erratic rainfall and flooding, and marine heat leading to collapsing fisheries. There is one periodic threat of Tsunami. The good news is there is some work ongoing already, the Ramanathapuram Mega CWSS Project is the most notable, impacting water supply for 100% of the district's citizens.   Part II has risk mitigations to help optimize for ecological, economic, and citizen population health for the bioregions of Tamil Nadu: Ramanathapuram. Unfortunately, the severity of the risks mean acting in the next five years to mitigate these risks is critical, especially if CWSS has major delays.


"Overall, Ramanathapuram is one of the most vulnerable districts in India, with a century-long water scarcity problem and fragile ecosystems like the Gulf of Mannar. There is a near-complete coral reef death in Gulf of Mannar estimated by 2028-2029, with 90% seagrass meadow loss ending marine nursery habitats. There is a severe watershed degradation with 80-90% forest cover loss and overuse of aquifer water causing Irreversible salinization of 60-70% of agricultural land.

#### 1.  Data We Cannot Access Due to Various Factors (listed) and What Pythia Cannot Do -  as Pythia is decision support tool and, not integrated automations 



#### 2.  Current Decision-Making Process (Estimated) 

Article 243G of the Indian Constitution and various state acts establish the April 1 - March 31 fiscal year for all government bodies including districts.

Standard Annual Cycle (Based on Government of India Guidelines)
April-May: Budget Preparation Phase

Constitutional requirement: Annual budget preparation for next fiscal year
Process: Districts submit budget estimates to state governments
Authority: District Planning Committees (Article 243ZD) prepare development plans
Timeline: Most states require district budget submissions by May 31

June-August: Budget Approval & Monsoon Management

June: State budget sessions typically conclude, district allocations finalized
July-August: Focus shifts to monsoon management and disaster preparedness
Authority: District Disaster Management Authority (under DM Act 2005) becomes primary focus

September-October: Mid-Year Review

September: Half-yearly expenditure review mandated by state finance departments
October: Post-monsoon damage assessment required under NDRF guidelines
Process: Supplementary budget requests for disaster relief

November-February: Implementation Season

Peak construction period: Most states restrict major construction during monsoon (July-September)
Annual planning: Preparation for next year's budget cycle begins in January
Performance reviews: Annual performance assessments of district officials

March: Fiscal Year Closure

Budget closure: All expenditures must be completed/accounted for by March 31
Audit preparation: CAG audit requirements for annual accounts
Project completion: Deadline for annual project deliverables

Established Decision Windows
Major Policy Decisions: April-May & November-December

State government budget sessions typically April-June

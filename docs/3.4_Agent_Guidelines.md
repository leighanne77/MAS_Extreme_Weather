# Agent Guidelines

**Date Created**: June 20, 2025
**Date Last Updated**: June 29, 2025

in the ADK, tools are essentially regular Python functions that the framework automatically transforms into callable tools when added to an agent's tool list.

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### General Rules
- Always check tool return status before using results
- Handle errors appropriately based on error type
- Verify confidence scores before using results
- Use tools only for their intended purposes
- Follow function-based tool implementation patterns
- Return consistent dictionary structures with status indicators

### Error Handling
- For transient errors: retry with exponential backoff
- For permanent errors: fall back to alternative tools
- Always check error messages for specific guidance
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external services
- Use graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Tool Selection
- Choose tools based on the specific task requirements
- Don't use tools for purposes they weren't designed for
- Consider tool confidence scores when making decisions
- Chain tools appropriately when needed
- Validate tool parameters before execution
- Monitor tool performance and resource usage

## Climate Risk Analysis Specific Guidelines

### Risk Assessment Tools
- Always validate location data before risk analysis
- Use multiple data sources for risk assessment
- Include confidence levels in risk assessments
- Consider temporal aspects of climate risks
- Validate risk thresholds against historical data
- Document risk assessment methodology

### Nature-Based Solutions Tools
- Prioritize nature-based solutions over structural solutions
- Consider local ecosystem compatibility
- Include cost-benefit analysis for all solutions
- Validate solution applicability for specific locations

- Document solution effectiveness metrics

### Data Quality Guidelines
- Validate weather data sources before analysis
- Check data completeness and accuracy
- Use multiple data sources for cross-validation

### Financial Analysis Guidelines
- Provide clear cost estimates with ranges
- Include ROI calculations for all solutions
- Consider different time horizons for analysis

## Agent Communication

### Inter-Agent Communication

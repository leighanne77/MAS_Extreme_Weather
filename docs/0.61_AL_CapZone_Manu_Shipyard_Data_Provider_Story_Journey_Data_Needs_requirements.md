Pythia System Parts: Basic -> Better -> Advanced

Basic
Part One: Basic - Secure Data Submission and Verification

Data Provider Problems Pythia Solves in this Part:
- No secure way to submit local knowledge and scientific data without losing control over the data
- No ability to contribute expertise to investment decisions that affect local ecosystems
- No platform to monetize specialized local knowledge and scientific expertise
- No way to ensure data is used responsibly and confidentially

Step 1. Data Provider Onboarding, Start

Pythia Prompt: "Welcome, we are glad you are interested in helping us as a data provider, what do you do?"

Data Provider Response: "I am a marine biologist with 20 years of experience studying Mobile Bay ecosystems. I have data on water quality trends, red tide patterns, and coastal erosion rates that could help inform manufacturing facility siting and design decisions. I want to contribute this data securely and be compensated for my expertise."

Pythia Response: "Welcome to Pythia's secure data contribution platform. Your expertise in Mobile Bay ecosystems is valuable for informing investment decisions that affect bioregional health. Here's how we can work together securely:

**Data Submission Process:**
- Your data remains under your control at all times
- We use Google Cloud Confidential Compute to process your data without storing it
- Our A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol ensures secure data transmission
- Your data is only used for generating risk assessment scenarios, never stored permanently

**Verification Process:**
- We cross-verify your data against multiple third-party sources (NOAA, USGS, EPA)
- This verification happens in secure, isolated compute environments
- Your original data is never shared with third parties
- Verification results are used to enhance confidence in scenario generation

**Compensation Structure:**
- Base compensation for data contribution: $X per verified dataset
- Bonus for high-quality, frequently referenced data: $Y per quarter
- Expert consultation fees: $Z per hour for specialized analysis
- Revenue sharing for data that leads to successful nature-based solutions

Step 2: Pythia Prompt: "We have a few follow-up questions to onboard you, including what geographic regions you cover. Stop at any time to ask questions you want about the system."

**Onboarding Questions:**
1. **Geographic Coverage**: What specific areas of Mobile Bay do you have expertise in?
2. **Data Types**: What types of data do you have (water quality, biodiversity, erosion rates, etc.)?
3. **Data Format**: How do you currently store your data?
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
   - REST API
   - Database (SQL, NoSQL)
   - Spreadsheets or CSV files
   - Other formats
4. **Update Frequency**: How often do you collect or update your data?
5. **Data Quality**: What quality control measures do you use for your data?
6. **Expertise Areas**: What specific areas of Mobile Bay ecosystem health do you specialize in?
7. **Collaboration Preferences**: Are you open to collaborating with other experts in the region?
8. **Compensation Preferences**: What type of compensation structure works best for you?

**Multi-Agent System Data Access Methods:**
- **MCP Server Integration**: If you have an MCP server, our agents can directly query your data securely
- **API Integration**: If you have a REST API, we can integrate with proper authentication
- **Database Connection**: For databases, we can establish secure connections with read-only access
- **File Upload**: For other formats, we can process files in secure compute environments

## Executive Summary

Today's work focused on integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into our multi-agent climate risk analysis system and implementing a comprehensive climate model downscaling strategy. We successfully enhanced our data source management, integrated three major MCP servers, and planned a two-phase climate model implementation approach.

  - Ensemble statistics computation (mean, spread, quantiles)
  - Dynamic downscaling and bias correction
  - User preference memory for multiple geographies/use cases
  - Real-time updates of climate model outputs
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned, Medium Priority

#### **Files Updated**:

### 3. Documentation Enhancements

#### **First_Data_Sources.md Updates**:
- Added dedicated sections for each MCP server with comprehensive descriptions
- Updated common data sources to include MCP servers across all categories
- Added integration benefits and data source consolidation details
- Enhanced data source table with MCP server references

#### **Engineering_Roadmap.md Updates**:

- **DO NOT** promise carbon sequestration outcomes or carbon reduction metrics
- **DO NOT** use carbon-related terminology in user communications or documentation
- **USE INSTEAD**: Risks, risk mitigation, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and environmental benefits

### 3. Proprietary Data Restrictions
- **DO NOT** promise results that require access to user's proprietary data that we cannot use
- **DO NOT** promise features that rely on user's proprietary data that we cannot access
- **DO NOT** suggest integrations that would require user to share confidential business information

- **INSTEAD**: Tool provides expert and external data sources (weather, environmental, scientific) to enhance user's existing proprietary data and decision-making processes
- **INSTEAD**: Users can combine Tool's external data insights with their own proprietary data for enhanced risk assessment and decision-making

### 4. Value Proposition Boundaries
- **DO NOT** go beyond the value propositions outlined in `0.6_DRAFT_DNU_User_Journeys_by_Prototypes.md`
- **DO NOT** promise features not explicitly mentioned in the user journey documentation

## Enforcement

- All documentation should reference this file when discussing new features
- All development should be validated against these guidelines
- All user communications should be reviewed for compliance
- Regular audits should be conducted to ensure adherence 
- again, do not truncate or remove anything unless
